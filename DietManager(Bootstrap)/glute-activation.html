    <h1>Glute Activation Workout - Knee Friendly Butt and Thigh Workout</h1>

      We get a lot of requests for butt and thigh workouts for bad knees,
      or knee friendly workouts - we also get a lot of requests for band workouts;
      this routine has both. It's a fantastic workout for developing and activating the glutes,
      as well as building important strength and stability in the joints of the lower body.
      If you have been told that you have lazy glutes, this glute activation workout may be of help to you.

      <br><br>
      All you're going to need for this workout is an exercise band,
      but even if you don't have equipment this is still a great workout,
      even with just your own bodyweight. Otherwise, any resistance band will do;
      the one I am using is just a simple strip of theraband tied into a knot.
      I like these because the band just remains constantly adjustable for whatever
      you might need (I untie & use this one for upper body routines as well).
      The bands also come precut in a variety of resistances (you get less product
      overall but this is a less expensive option). Some of the exercises are a bit
      slow moving, but this is part of the challenge. Using momentum or swinging/"cheating"
      motions would cut out the emphasis on building strength throughout the entire range
      of motion. Keep in mind that each of the exercises is made more beneficial by your
      mindfulness and paying attention to how you're holding your body and moving throughout the workout.

      <br><br>
      We just released a brand new 4 Week Program! You get to choose your workout
      length each day, depending on your own schedule and energy levels:
      <b>4 Week FB Blend - Burn Fat, Build Muscle, Tone; 35 or 55 Minutes a Day</b>

      <br><br>
      This workout has been modeled after a patellar tendonitis
      physical therapy routine, though it also heavily crosses over
      with a hip strengthening physical therapy routine (both of which
      I have discussed at length with multiple doctors and physical therapists).
      A lot of you may recognize these exercises if you are seeing a physical
      therapist for hip or knee issues. With that said, it's important to note
      that I am a certified personal trainer - not a physical therapist - and
      you should always, always talk to your personal, professional health care
      provider (who has all of your health information and history) to make sure
      than an exercise is safe and beneficial for you and your body specifically.
